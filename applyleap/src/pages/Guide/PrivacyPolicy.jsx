      Personal Data and Usage Data may be freely provided, or they may be

      give Personal Data unless otherwise stated. If users do not provide this

      Cookies and other tracking technologies are used by us and in the services
      offered by third-party providers to track visitors, as stated in the
      current document and Cookie Policy, if available. Users are responsible
      for any Personal Data obtained, published, or shared via our Service. They
      certify that the third party’s permission to supply the Information to us.
      <h2>How will the data be used, and where will it be processed?</h2>
      Methods of processing We have implemented appropriate security measures to
      prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or destruction of
      the Data. Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT-enabled
      tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to
      the purposes indicated. In addition to us, in some cases, the Data may be
      accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the
      operation of our Service (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system
      administration) or external parties (such as third-party technical service
      providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications
      agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by us. An updated
      list of these parties may be requested from us at any time. What is the
      legal basis for data processing? We may process User Data if one of the
      following applies: Users have given their consent to the usage of their
      personal information for a particular reason or set of reasons. Note: In
      some jurisdictions, we may be permitted to process Personal Data without
      obtaining consent or any of the following legal grounds if the User does
      not object (“opt-out”), despite the fact that consent is required by law.
      However, this principle does not apply whenever Personal Data processing
      is governed by European data protection law. All data that is necessary
      for the performance of a contract with a User and/or for any
      pre-contractual obligations thereof is required to be supplied. If we are
      subject to a legal obligation, any data that must be processed for
      compliance with such an obligation are required. When it refers to a task
      that the public has a right to, or when it concerns official authority
      vested in us and carried out in the public interest, data processing is
      necessary. The data processing is required as part of our or a third
      party’s legitimate interests. In any case, we will do everything to
      explain the specific legal basis for processing, including whether
      providing Personal Data is a statutory or contractual obligation, as well
      as whether it is required to enter into a contract. Where is the Place for
      data processing? The Data is handled by our operational offices and any
      other locations where the parties involved in the processing are situated.
      Depending on their location, users’ data may be transferred to a country
      other than their own. Users can discover more about processing such
      transmitted data by consulting the section containing information about
      how Personal Data is processed. Customers also have the right to know the
      legal basis for data transfers to a country outside of the European Union
      or any other international organization governed by public international
      law or established by two or more nations, such as the UN, and about the
      security precautions taken by us to safeguard their Data. Users can
      discover more by reading the relevant sections of this agreement or
      contacting us using the information provided in the contact section if any
      such transfer occurs. Data Retention time Personal data will be kept as
      long as is necessary for the initially collected purposes. Therefore:
      Personal data collected in order to execute a contract between us and the
      User is kept until the work has been completed. The Personal Data of this
      data subject shall be kept as long as it is relevant and necessary to
      achieve our objectives. Users might learn more about our real interests by
      reading through the relevant sections of the documents or contacting us.
      If the User has given consent to such processing, we may be permitted to
      keep Personal Data for a more extended period if such consent is not
      withdrawn. Furthermore, if required to do so for the performance of a
      legal obligation or at the request of an authority, we may be obligated to
      keep Personal Data for a more extended period. Personal data no longer
      needed shall be erased after the retention period has ended. As a result,
      the right to access, the right to erasure, rectification, and data
      portability rights cannot be enforced after the retention period has
      ended.

      information and direct any of our service providers to do so as a result
      of exercising your right. How to exercise your rights To exercise the
      rights described above, you need to submit your verifiable request by
      contacting us via the details provided in this document. To respond to
      your request, it’s necessary that we know who you are. Therefore, you can
      only exercise the above rights by making a verifiable request which must:
      provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are
      the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized
      representative; describe your request with sufficient detail that allows
      us to understand, evaluate, and respond to it properly. We will not
      respond to any request if we cannot verify your identity and therefore
      confirm the personal information in our possession relates to you. If you
      cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can authorize a person
      registered with the California Secretary of State to act on your behalf.
      If you are an adult, you can make a verifiable request for a minor under
      your parental authority. You can submit a maximum number of 2 requests
      over 12 months. How and when we are expected to handle your request We
      will confirm receipt of your verifiable request within 10 days and provide
      information about how we will process your request. We will respond to
      your request within 45 days of its receipt. Should we need more time, we
      will explain to you the reasons why and how much more time we need. In
      this regard, please note that we may take up to 90 days to fulfill your
      request. Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12 month period.
      Should we deny your request, we will explain to you the reasons behind our
      denial. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable
      request unless such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. We may
      charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act on the request in such cases. In
      either case, we will communicate our choices and explain the reasons
      behind them.
