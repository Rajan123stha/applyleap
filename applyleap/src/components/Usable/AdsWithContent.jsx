        Balancing Content and Ads
      </h2>

      <p>
        One of the best practices is to keep ads naturally embedded within the
        content. Placing ads between well-structured paragraphs increases
        visibility while ensuring a non-intrusive experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ads placed within the reading flow often perform better than those
        placed at the beginning or end of an article. The key is strategic
        positioning.

        User Experience Matters
      </h2>

      <p>
        Avoid overloading your page with ads, as excessive ad placement can
        negatively impact user retention and SEO rankings. Instead, focus on
        delivering quality content while optimizing monetization strategies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ensuring readability and spacing between ads creates a seamless
        experience, making users more likely to engage with your website.
